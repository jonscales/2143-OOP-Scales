## P01 - Creating a Vector Class
### Jon Scales
### Creating a Vector Class with multiple functions to manipulate vectors

### Files
| #|File|Desccription  |
|:-:|----|------------|
| 1|main.cpp| uses vector class to create vectors and demonstrate functions of class|
|2| vector.cpp| contains vector class function definitions|
|3|vecto.h|contains class definition and vector prototypes|
|4|vectorvals.txt|list of numbers to utilize in vector construction|

###Instructions

the Main.cpp implements the vector class and demonstrates useage of all the functions. 
Main requires vector.cpp and vector.h and vectorvals.txt to be in same directory to run
