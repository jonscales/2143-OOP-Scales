# Abstraction

### TOC

## Abstraction is the concept of taking complex functional methods and

## packaging them so the details of the underlying processes are hidden

## while providing an interface for the user to run the processes that is

## simple and intuitive.

## The functions and methods of a class can be utilized by other

## programmers or users by simply instantiating a class.

## Example code:

### class Shape {

### public:

### virtual float area() = 0;

### };

### class Circle : public Shape {

### private:

### float radius;

### public:

### Circle(float r) {

### radius = r;

### }

### float area() {

### return 3.14 * radius * radius;

### }

### };

## In this example, the Shape class is an abstract class that defines the

## area() method without providing an implementation. The Circle class

## inherits from Shape and provides its own implementation of the area()

## method. This allows users to create Circle objects without knowing the

## details of how the area is calculated.


# Attributes/properties

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:27 AM

### TOC

## An attribute, also called a data member, is a variable that holds data

## associated with an object of a class.

## Example code:

### class Car {

### public:

### string make;

### string model;

### int year;

### };

## In this example, make, model, and year are attributes of the Car class.


# Class

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:27 AM

### TOC

## A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the

## attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.

## Example Code:

### class Animal {

### public:

### std::string name;

### int age;

### void speak() {

### std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old." <<

### std::endl;

### }

### };


# Class variable

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:27 AM

### TOC

## Class Variable/Static Variable

## A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. It is

## declared using the static keyword.

### Example Code

### class Animal {

### public:

### static int count;

### std::string name;

### int age;

### Animal(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {

### count++;

### }

### };

### int Animal::count = 0;


# Composition

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:27 AM

### TOC

## Composition is a way of creating complex objects by combining simpler

## objects. In C++, this is done by including objects of one class within

## another class.

## Example Code:

class Engine {
public:
void start() {
std::cout << "Engine started." << std::endl;
}
};
class Car {
public:
Engine engine;
void start() {
engine.start();
std::cout << "Car started." << std::endl;
}
};


# Constructor

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is

## created. It is used to initialize the object's member variables. A

## constructor will be the same name as the class and the function is

## defined without a return type.

## Example Code

class Animal {
public:
std::string name;
int age;
Animal(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {
std::cout << "An animal has been created." << std::endl;
}
};

## In this example, an instance of the Animal class is created using the

## Animal (string n, int a) constructor function.


# Encapsulation

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of a class

## from outside code. It is achieved by making member variables private

## and providing public methods to access and modify them.

## Example code:

class BankAccount {
private:
double balance;
public:
void deposit(double amount) {
balance += amount;
}
double getBalance() {
return balance;
}
};


# Friend

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## A friend is a function or class that is given access to the private

## members of another class.

## Example Code

class Animal {
private:
int age;
friend void setAge(Animal& animal, int age);
public:
std::string name;
Animal(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
void speak() {
std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
}
};
void setAge(Animal& animal, int age) {
animal.age = age;
}


# Inheritance

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## Inheritance is a way of creating a new class by deriving from an existing

## class. The new class, called the derived class, inherits the attributes and

## methods of the existing class, called the base class.

## Example Code:

class Animal {
public:
std::string name;
int age;
void speak() {
std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
}
};
class Cat : public Animal {
public:
void purr() {
std::cout << name << " is purring." << std::endl;
}
};


# Instance variable

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## An instance variable, also called an instance field or instance member,

## is an attribute that belongs to a specific instance of a class.

## Example Code:

class Car {
public:
string make;
string model;
int year;
Car(string m, string mdl, int y) {
make = m;
model = mdl;
year = y;
}
};
Car myCar("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);

## In this example, make, model, and year are instance variables of the Car

## class. The values assigned to these variables when the myCar object is

## created are specific to that instance of the Car class.


# Member variable

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## A member variable, also called a class variable, is a variable that

## belongs to a class as a whole rather than to a specific instance of the

## class. Member variables are declared with the static keyword.

class Car {
public:
static int count;
string make;
string model;
int year;
Car(string m, string mdl, int y) {
make = m;
model = mdl;
year = y;
count++;
}
};
int Car::count = 0;
Car car1("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);
Car car2("Honda", "Accord", 2019);
cout << Car::count; // Output: 2

## In this example, count is a member variable of the Car class. It is

## declared as static, so there is only one instance of it for the entire Car

## class. Each time a new Car object is created, the constructor increments

## the count variable. The output shows that two Car objects have been

## created.


# Method

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## A method is a function that is associated with a class and can be

## called on objects of that class. It can access and modify the data

## members of the class.

## Example Code:

```
class Car {
public:
string make;
string model;
int year;
void printInfo() {
cout << make << " " << model << " " << year << endl;
}
};
Car myCar;
myCar.make = "Toyota";
myCar.model =
```

# Multiple inheritance

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## Multiple inheritance is a feature of some OOP languages that allows a

## class to inherit from more than one base class. This can lead to the

## Diamond problem where ambiguity arises due to multiple

## implementations of a method from different base classes.

## Example Code:

class Vehicle {
public:
virtual void move() = 0;
};
class Car : public Vehicle {
// Implementation
};
class Boat : public Vehicle {
// Implementation
};
class AmphibiousVehicle : public Car, public Boat {
// Implementation
};


# Object

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## An object is an instance of a class. It has its own unique state and

## behavior, and can access the attributes and methods of its class.

## Example code:

Car myCar;
myCar.make = "Toyota";
myCar.model = "Corolla";
myCar.year = 2021;


# Overloading

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## Overloading is the ability to define multiple functions with the same

## name but different parameters. This allows for more flexibility in the

## use of the function.

## Example Code:

class Math {
public:
int add(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}
double add(double a, double b) {
return a + b;
}
};


# Overriding

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:37 AM

### TOC

## Overriding is a feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that

## allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a

## method that is already provided by its parent class or superclass. This

## means that when the method is called on an object of the subclass, the

## implementation provided by the subclass will be executed, rather than

## the implementation provided by the superclass. Overriding is an

## important concept in inheritance.

## Example Code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Base class
class Shape {
public:
virtual void draw() {
cout << "Drawing Shape" << endl;
}
};
// Derived class
class Circle: public Shape {
public:
void draw() {
cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
}
};
int main(void) {
Shape *shape;
Circle circle;
// calling draw method of Shape using pointer to Circle object
shape = &circle;
shape->draw(); // Will call the draw method of Circle class
return 0;
}


# Polymorphism

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated

## as if they were objects of the same class. This is achieved through

## inheritance and virtual functions.

## Example Code:

class Vehicle {
public:
virtual void move() = 0;
};
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
void move() {
// Implementation
}
};
class Boat : public Vehicle {
public:
void move() {
// Implementation
}
};
void makeMove(Vehicle& v) {
v.move();
}
Car myCar;
Boat myBoat;
makeMove(myCar);
makeMove(myBoat);


# Public/Private/Protected

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## In object-oriented programming, access modifiers such as public,

## private, and protected are used to control the visibility of class

## members (i.e., variables and methods) from outside the class. These

## modifiers determine how accessible a class member is to other

## parts of the program.

 (^) Public: Public members are accessible from anywhere in the program,

## including from outside the class. They are often used for methods and

## variables that need to be accessed from other classes.^

## ^ Private: Private members are only accessible within the class they are defined

## in. They cannot be accessed from outside the class, including from derived

## classes. They are often used for variables and methods that should only be

## used internally by the class.^

## ^ Protected: Protected members are accessible within the class they are

## defined in and any derived classes. They cannot be accessed from outside the

## class or its derived classes. They are often used for variables and methods

## that need to be accessed by derived classes but should not be public.^

## Example Code:

```
class MyClass {
public:
int publicVar;
void publicMethod() {
// Code for public method
}
private:
int privateVar;
void privateMethod() {
// Code for private method
}
```

protected:
int protectedVar;
void protectedMethod() {
// Code for protected method
}
};
int main() {
MyClass obj;
obj.publicVar = 1 ; // Accessing public member
obj.publicMethod(); // Calling public method
// obj.privateVar = 2; // Error: Cannot access private member
// obj.privateMethod();// Error: Cannot access private member
// obj.protectedVar = 3; // Error: Cannot access protected member
// obj.protectedMethod();// Error: Cannot access protected member
return 0 ;
}


# Static

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:28 AM

### TOC

## A static variable is a variable that is associated with the class rather

## than with individual objects of the class. It can be accessed without

## creating an instance of the class, and its value is shared across all

## objects of the class.

## Here is an example code snippet in C++ that demonstrates the usage of

## a static variable:

## Example Code:

class MyClass {
public:
static int count; // Declaration of static variable
MyClass() {
count++; // Increment count each time an object is created
}
};
int MyClass::count = 0; // Definition of static variable
int main() {
MyClass obj1;
MyClass obj2;
MyClass obj3;
std::cout << "Number of objects created: " << MyClass::count << std::endl; // Accessing static variable
return 0;
}


# Virtual

Tuesday, April 25, 2023
10:29 AM

### TOC

## A virtual function is a function that is declared in a base class and can

## be overridden in derived classes. It allows derived classes to provide

## their own implementation of the function, which is called instead of the

## base class implementation when the function is called on an object of

## the derived class.

## Example Code:

class Shape {
public:
virtual void draw() {
std::cout << "Drawing a shape" << std::endl;
}
};
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
void draw() override {
std::cout << "Drawing a circle" << std::endl;
}
};
int main() {
Shape* shape = new Circle(); // Upcasting
shape->draw(); // Calling virtual function
delete shape;
return 0;
}
