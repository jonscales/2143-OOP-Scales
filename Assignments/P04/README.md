# Utilization
Conversion of C++ to python to create 2 classes to handle the rolling of single or multiple die for gaming programs. 

Main.py will run a set of example dice rolls and results.  It will then ask for user input of a dice type (# of sides), dice number,  how many rolls and what type of result the user wishes (sum of die values, max, min or average die value from a set of multiple dice).  Run the program in replit [here](https://replit.com/@jonscales/dice#main.py)
